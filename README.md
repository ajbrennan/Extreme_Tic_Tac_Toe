# Extreme_Tic_Tac_Toe
I created an extreme tic tac toe game for my final project in the intro to Matlab course at Case Western Reserve University. Extreme tic tac toe involves playing tic tac toe games within tic tac toe games (example of the rules can be viewed here https://ultimate-t3.herokuapp.com/rules). The game can be played as 1-player (mainGame1p.m) or 2-player (mainGame2p.m).
